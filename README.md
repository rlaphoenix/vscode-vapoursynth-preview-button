## Usage

- Script file must use the `.vpy` file extension.
- Set the language associated with `.vpy` files to Python.
- Add [vse-previewer] to your environment path so that the `vse-previewer` binary can be found and used.

Note: This extension has no settings.

## Known Issues

- Keybindings should be Shift+Space (or Cmd+Shift+Space on Mac) but they do not work.
